# VoidShips
My first legit Minecraft plugin, spaceships with vacuum physics and antigravity and solar systems and planets and stuff.

The idea is to make a somewhat realistic spaceship pvp game.

The universe is composed of numerous solar systems, and planets (their distances and properties can be configured).

Time runs just as fast as in Minecraft, one day in minecraft is 20 minutes, and thus one earth-day is 20 minutes, meaning time runs 72x faster.

When battling another ship, the first step is to find that ship. Scans can only travel at the speed of light, so if you're tracking a ship on the opposite side of the solar system, the signal might take 15 minutes to get there, and then 15 minutes to return, so a 30 minute round trip, which would be 25 seconds in-game.
So you would know where that ship was 25 seconds ago.

If the enemy ship is in a different solar system, such as Proxima Centauri (the nearest system to ours), a signal would take 8.5 years to travel round trip, and chances are it won't even return conclusive results, you might as well just turn on a beacon so that 4.2 years from now the enemy knows where you are and can start heading over to you.

To not make this incredibly boring, I have included a couple remedies. Each solar system is equiped with a wormhole that spawns in a random spot near the star, and this wormhole can instantly teleport any vessel to any other wormhole (provided the vessel is equiped with a wormhole drive). Additionally, it is possible to equip your ship with a hyperdrive like from Star Wars, which can get you to Kepler-8 (3.3k lightyears) in an hour, or 50 seconds in-game time.

So how do you locate the enemy ship?
You send a probe through the wormhole, have it scan various systems, you send out a beacon to reveal your location and then set a trap for when the enemy ship enters the system.

Ok you found the enemy ship, what now?
Engage WeaponTargetingSystems and poke holes in their bulkhead with bullets, or blow them up with a missile.

Or you could attempt to get close enough to board their ship.
